	Abstract = {As an obligate pathogen, the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi has a streamlined genome that encodes only two two-component signal transduction systems, Hk1-Rrp1 and Hk2-Rrp2 (in addition to CheA-CheY systems). The output of Hk1-Rrp1 is the production of the second messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP), which is indispensable for B. burgdorferi to survive in the tick vector. The output of Hk2-Rrp2 is the transcriptional activation of the global regulator RpoS, which is essential for the pathogen to accomplish its tick-mouse transmission and to establish mammalian infection. Although evidence indicates that these two systems communicate with each other, how they are connected is not fully understood. In this study, we showed that the c-di-GMP-binding protein PlzA, a downstream effector of Rrp1, positively modulates the production of RpoS, a global regulator and downstream target of Rrp2. Thus, PlzA functions as a connector that links Hk1-Rrp1 with Hk2-Rrp2. We further showed that PlzA regulates rpoS expression through modulation of another regulator, BosR, at both the transcriptional and the posttranscriptional levels. In addition, PlzA was also capable of regulating rpoS expression independently of Rrp1, suggesting that besides being a c-di-GMP-binding protein, PlzA has other functions. Along with the previous finding of PlzA controlling motility, these studies demonstrate that PlzA is a multifunctional protein. These findings further reinforce the notion that B. burgdorferi utilizes its limited signaling systems and regulators to govern multiple cellular processes during its complex enzootic cycle between ticks and mammals.},

@article{avci-adali_absolute_2013,
	Abstract = {In the fields of diagnosis, imaging, regenerative medicine, and drug targeting, aptamers are promising nucleic acid ligands for specific recognition and binding of whole living cells. These aptamers are selected by a combinatorial chemistry technique called cell-SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment). During this iterative procedure of in vitro selection and enzymatic amplification, the enrichment of cell binding aptamers is generally monitored by flow cytometry. This method needs the use of fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotides for detection and allows only the relative evaluation of the aptamer binding compared with the control. Here, we describe the development and validation of a new quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method for the absolute determination of cell bound aptamers during cell-SELEX. The method is based on SYBR Green I real-time PCR technology and uses an aptamer standard curve to determine the accurate aptamer amount on cells after the incubations. Lysates of cells with bound aptamers were used to identify the absolute amount of aptamers on cells. This method is highly sensitive and allows the detection of very small quantities of aptamers in cell lysate samples. The lower detection limit is 20 fg. The established qPCR method can be used as an additional monitoring tool during cell-SELEX to determine the enrichment of cell binding aptamers on cells, whereby the absolute quantity is determined. Furthermore, the contamination of the amplified aptamer pool with by-products can be prevented by prior determination of bound aptamer amount on cells.},

@book{samuels_borrelia:_2010,
	Abstract = {The genus Borrelia, in the spirochete phylum, is not closely related to any other bacteria and has a highly unusual genome composed of a linear chromosome and multiple circular and linear plasmids that appear to be in a constant state of rearrangement, recombination, and deletion. The determination of the genome sequence of Borrelia strains has facilitated tremendous advances in understanding this genus at the molecular and cellular level, as well as the pathogenesis of Lyme disease and relapsing fever. In recent years, there has been an explosion of new insights into the molecular biology, genetics, physiology, and ecology of Borrelia and its tick/vertebrate life cycle. This research is of particular importance as the incidence of Lyme borreliosis continues to increase. Written by renowned scientists who have made seminal contributions to the field, this book is a comprehensive guide to the pathogenic Borrelia, providing researchers, advanced students, clinicians, and other professionals with an encyclopedic overview of the molecular biology of this important genus and the pathogenesis of diseases. Leading authorities have made contributions on topics such as Borrelia genomics, DNA replication, gene regulation, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolism and physiology, cellular structure, motility and chemotaxis, genetic manipulation, evolutionary genetics, ecology, tick interactions, Lyme disease and relapsing fever pathogenesis, animal models, host response, detection, and vaccines. The volume is essential for anyone involved in Borrelia research and is strongly recommended for microbiologists, immunologists, and physicians involved in spirochete research, Lyme borreliosis, or relapsing fever. The book is a recommended reference volume for all microbiology libraries.},

@article{bugrysheva_characterization_2015,
	Abstract = {The bacterial stringent response is triggered by deficiencies of available nutrients and other environmental stresses. It is mediated by 5'-triphosphate-guanosine-3'-diphosphate and 5'-diphosphate-guanosine-3'-diphosphate (collectively (p)ppGpp) and generates global changes in gene expression and metabolism that enable bacteria to adapt to and survive these challenges. Borrelia burgdorferi encounters multiple stressors in its cycling between ticks and mammals that could trigger the stringent response. We have previously shown that the B. burgdorferi stringent response is mediated by a single enzyme, RelBbu, with both (p)ppGpp synthase and hydrolase activities, and that a B. burgdorferi 297 relBbu null deletion mutant was defective in adapting to stationary phase, incapable of down-regulating synthesis of rRNA and could not infect mice. We have now used this deletion mutant and microarray analysis to identify genes comprising the rel regulon in B. burgdorferi cultured at 34$\,^{\circ}$C, and found that transcription of genes involved in glycerol metabolism is induced by relBbu. Culture of the wild type parental strain, the relBbu deletion mutant and its complemented derivative at 34$\,^{\circ}$C and 25$\,^{\circ}$C in media containing glucose or glycerol as principal carbon sources revealed a growth defect in the mutant, most evident at the lower temperature. Transcriptional analysis of the glp operon for glycerol uptake and metabolism in these three strains confirmed that relBbu was necessary and sufficient to increase transcription of this operon in the presence of glycerol at both temperatures. These results confirm and extend previous findings regarding the stringent response in B. burgdorferi. They also demonstrate that the stringent response regulates glycerol metabolism in this organism and is likely crucial for its optimal growth in ticks.},

@article{ouyang_badr_2015,
	Abstract = {In Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the alternative sigma factor RpoS plays a central role during Bb's adaptation to ticks and mammals. Previous studies have demonstrated that RpoS is not expressed during the early stages of spirochetal growth or when Bb resides in ticks during the intermolt phase, but the molecular details of these events remain unknown. In the current study, biomagnetic bead separation of rpoS promoter-binding proteins, coupled with genetic inactivation, was employed to identify BadR (BB0693) as a negative regulator that controls growth phase-dependent induction of rpoS and bosR in Bb. When badR was inactivated, the expression of rpoS and bosR was induced only during the early stages of bacterial growth, but not during the stationary growth phase. Recombinant BadR bound to the promoter DNA of rpoS and the regulatory region upstream of bosR via AT-rich TAAAATAT motifs. Mutations in this motif markedly inhibited or abolished rBadR binding. These results suggest that BadR directly influences the expression of both rpoS and bosR in Bb. This newly recognized role for BadR to fine-tune the activation of the RpoN--RpoS pathway at strategic times in Bb's life cycle potentially represents another layer of gene control over σ54-dependent gene regulation.},

@article{hyde_characterization_2010,
	Abstract = {Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological agent of Lyme disease, adapts to unique host environments as a consequence of its complex life cycle that spans both arthropod and mammalian species. In this regard, B. burgdorferi must adapt to various environmental signals, pHs, temperatures, and O2 and CO2 levels to establish infectious foci. We hypothesize that the BosR protein functions as a global regulator that is required for both borrelial oxidative homeostasis and pathogenesis. To assess the role of BosR in B. burgdorferi, we constructed an IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside)-regulated bosR strain. The selective decrease of bosR resulted in a change in growth when cells were cultured either anaerobically or microaerobically; however, a distinct growth defect was observed for anaerobically grown B. burgdorferi relative to the growth attenuation observed for microaerobically grown B. burgdorferi. B. burgdorferi cells in which BosR levels were reduced were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and produced lower levels of NapA (Dps) and SodA, proteins involved in the oxidative stress response. In addition, the levels of OspC and DbpA were also induced coincident with increased BosR levels, suggesting that BosR interfaces with the RpoS regulatory cascade, which is known to modulate virulence gene expression in B. burgdorferi. Taken together, these results indicate that BosR is involved in the resistance of B. burgdorferi to oxidative stressors and affects the expression of genes, either directly or indirectly, whose products are important in borrelial pathogenesis.},

@article{bauer_structural_2015,
	Abstract = {Two-component signal transduction systems are the primary mechanisms by which bacteria perceive and respond to changes in their environment. The Hk1/Rrp1 two-component system (TCS) in Borrelia burgdorferi consists of a hybrid histidine kinase and a response regulator with diguanylate cyclase activity, respectively. Phosphorylated Rrp1 catalyzes the synthesis of c-di-GMP, a second messenger associated with bacterial life-style control networks. Spirochetes lacking either Hk1 or Rrp1 are virulent in mice but destroyed within feeding ticks. Activation of Hk1 by exogenous stimuli represents the seminal event for c-di-GMP signaling. We reasoned that structural characterization of Hk1's sensor would provide insights into the mechanism underlying signal transduction and aid in the identification of activating ligands. The Hk1 sensor is composed of three ligand-binding domains (D1--3), each with homology to periplasmic solute-binding proteins (PBPs) typically associated with ABC transporters. Herein, we determined the structure for D1, the most N-terminal PBP domain. As expected, D1 displays a bilobed Venus Fly Trap-fold. Similar to the prototypical sensor PBPs HK29S from Geobacter sulfurreducens and VFT2 from Bordetella pertussis, apo-D1 adopts a closed conformation. Using complementary approaches, including SAXS, we established that D1 forms a dimer in solution. The D1 structure enabled us to model the D2 and D3 domains. Differences in the ligand-binding pockets suggest that each PBP recognizes a different ligand. The ability of Hk1 to recognize multiple stimuli provides spirochetes with a means of distinguishing between the acquisition and transmission blood meals and generate a graded output response that is reflective of the perceived environmental threats.},

@article{dulebohn_global_2014,
	Abstract = {Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, is a vector-borne pathogen that transits between Ixodes ticks and vertebrate hosts. During the natural infectious cycle, spirochetes must globally adjust their transcriptome to survive in these dissimilar environments. One way B. burgdorferi accomplishes this is through the use of alternative sigma factors to direct transcription of specific genes. RpoS, one of only three sigma factors in B. burgdorferi, controls expression of genes required during tick-transmission and infection of the mammalian host. How spirochetes switch between different sigma factors during the infectious cycle has remained elusive. Here we establish a role for a novel protein, BBD18, in the regulation of the virulence-associated sigma factor RpoS. Constitutive expression of BBD18 repressed transcription of RpoS-dependent genes to levels equivalent to those observed in an rpoS mutant. Consistent with the global loss of RpoS-dependent transcripts, we were unable to detect RpoS protein. However, constitutive expression of BBD18 did not diminish the amount of rpoS transcript, indicating post-transcriptional regulation of RpoS by BBD18. Interestingly, BBD18-mediated repression of RpoS is independent of both the rpoS promoter and the 5' untranslated region, suggesting a mechanism of protein destabilization rather than translational control. We propose that BBD18 is a novel regulator of RpoS and its activity likely represents a first step in the transition from an RpoS-ON to an RpoS-OFF state, when spirochetes transition from the host to the tick vector.},

	Abstract = {Zbed4, a member of the BED subclass of Zinc-finger proteins, is expressed in cone photoreceptors and glial M{\"u}ller cells of human retina whereas it is only present in M{\"u}ller cells of mouse retina. To characterize structural and functional properties of Zbed4, enough amounts of purified protein were needed. Thus, recombinant Zbed4 was expressed in E. coli and its refolding conditions optimized for the production of homogenous and functionally active protein. Zbed4's secondary structure, determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy, showed that this protein contains 32\% α-helices, 18\% β-sheets, 20\% turns and 30\% unordered structures. CASTing was used to identify the target sites of Zbed4 in DNA. The majority of the DNA fragments obtained contained poly-Gs and some of them had, in addition, the core signature of GC boxes; a few clones had only GC-boxes. With electrophoretic mobility shift assays we demonstrated that Zbed4 binds both not only to DNA and but also to RNA oligonucleotides with very high affinity, interacting with poly-G tracts that have a minimum of 5 Gs; its binding to and GC-box consensus sequences. However, the latter binding depends on the GC-box flanking nucleotides. We also found that Zbed4 interacts in Y79 retinoblastoma cells with nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins Scaffold Attachment Factor B1 (SAFB1), estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), and cellular myosin 9 (MYH9), as shown with immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry studies as well as gel overlay assays. In addition, immunostaining corroborated the co-localization of Zbed4 with these proteins. Most importantly, in vitro experiments using constructs containing promoters of genes directing expression of the luciferase gene, showed that Zbed4 transactivates the transcription of those promoters with poly-G tracts.},

	Abstract = {The alternative sigma factor RpoS in Borrelia burgdorferi plays a central role in modulating host adaptive responses when spirochaetes cycle between ticks and mammals. The transcriptional activation of σ(54)-dependent rpoS requires a Fur homologue designated BosR. Previously, BosR was shown to directly activate rpoS transcription by binding to the rpoS promoter. However, many other DNA binding features of BosR have remained obscure. In particular, the precise DNA sequence targeted by BosR has not yet been completely elucidated. The prediction of a putative Per box within the rpoS promoter region has further confounded the identification of the BosR binding sequence. Herein, by using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrate that the putative Per box predicted in the rpoS promoter region is not involved in the binding of BosR. Rather, a 13 bp palindromic sequence (ATTTAANTTAAAT) with dyad symmetry, which we denote as the 'BosR box', functions as the core sequence recognized by BosR in the rpoS promoter region of Borrelia burgdorferi. Similar to a Fur box and a Per box, the BosR box probably comprises a 6-1-6 inverted repeat composed of two hexamers (ATTTAA) in a head-to-tail orientation. Selected mutations in the BosR box prevented recombinant BosR from binding to rpoS.

	Abstract = {Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease spirochete, adapts as it moves between the arthropod and mammalian hosts that it infects. We hypothesize that BosR serves as a global regulator in B. burgdorferi to modulate the oxidative stress response and adapt to mammalian hosts. To test this hypothesis, a bosR mutant in a low-passage B. burgdorferi isolate was constructed. The resulting bosR::kanR strain was altered when grown microaerobically or anaerobically suggesting that BosR is required for optimal replication under both growth conditions. The absence of BosR increased the sensitivity of B. burgdorferi to hydrogen peroxide and reduced the synthesis of Cdr and NapA, proteins important for cellular redox balance and the oxidative stress response, respectively, suggesting an important role for BosR in borrelial oxidative homeostasis. For the bosR mutant, the production of RpoS was abrogated and resulted in the loss of OspC and DbpA, suggesting that BosR interfaces with the Rrp2--RpoN--RpoS regulatory cascade. Consistent with the linkage to RpoS, cells lacking bosR were non-infectious in the mouse model of infection. These results indicate that BosR is required for resistance to oxidative stressors and provides a regulatory response that is necessary for B. burgdorferi pathogenesis.},

@article{boylan_borrelia_2003,
	Abstract = {The ability of a pathogen to cause infection depends on successful colonization of the host, which, in turn, requires adaptation to various challenges presented by that host. For example, host immune cells use a variety of mechanisms to control infection by bacterial pathogens, including the production of bactericidal reactive oxygen species. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have developed ways of protecting themselves against this oxidative damage; for instance, Borrelia burgdorferi alters the expression of oxidative-stress-related proteins, such as a Dps/Dpr homolog NapA (BB0690), in response to increasing levels of oxygen and reactive oxygen species. These stress-related genes appear to be regulated by a putative metal-dependent DNA-binding protein (BB0647) that has 50.7\% similarity to the peroxide-specific stress response repressor of Bacillus subtilis, PerR. We overexpressed and purified this protein from Escherichia coli and designated it Borrelia oxidative stress regulator, BosR. BosR bound to a 50-nt region 180 bp upstream of the napA transcriptional start site and required DTT and Zn2+ for optimal binding. Unlike the Bacillus subtilis PerR repressor, BosR did not require Fe2+ and Mn2+ for binding, and oxidizing agents, such as t-butyl peroxide, enhanced, not eliminated, BosR binding to the napA promoter region. Surprisingly, transcriptional fusion analysis indicated that BosR exerted a positive regulatory effect on napA that is inducible with t-butyl peroxide. On the basis of these data, we propose that, despite the similarity to PerR, BosR functions primarily as a transcriptional activator, not a repressor of oxidative stress response, in B. burgdorferi.},

@article{ouyang_identification_2014-1,
	Abstract = {The alternative sigma factor RpoS in Borrelia burgdorferi plays a central role in modulating host adaptive responses when spirochaetes cycle between ticks and mammals. The transcriptional activation of sigma(54)-dependent rpoS requires a Fur homologue designated BosR. Previously, BosR was shown to directly activate rpoS transcription by binding to the rpoS promoter. However, many other DNA binding features of BosR have remained obscure. In particular, the precise DNA sequence targeted by BosR has not yet been completely elucidated. The prediction of a putative Per box within the rpoS promoter region has further confounded the identification of the BosR binding sequence. Herein, by using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrate that the putative Per box predicted in the rpoS promoter region is not involved in the binding of BosR. Rather, a 13 bp palindromic sequence (ATTTAANTTAAAT) with dyad symmetry, which we denote as the 'BosR box', functions as the core sequence recognized by BosR in the rpoS promoter region of Borrelia burgdorferi. Similar to a Fur box and a Per box, the BosR box probably comprises a 6-1-6 inverted repeat composed of two hexamers (ATTTAA) in a head-to-tail orientation. Selected mutations in the BosR box prevented recombinant BosR from binding to rpoS. In addition, we found that sequences neighbouring the BosR box also are required for the formation of BosR-DNA complexes. Identification of the BosR box advances our understanding of how BosR recognizes its DNA target(s), and provides new insight into the mechanistic details behind the unique regulatory function of BosR.},

@article{caimano_c-di-gmp_2015,
	Abstract = {B. burgdorferi (Bb), the Lyme disease spirochete, couples environmental sensing and gene regulation primarily via the Hk1/Rrp1 two component system (TCS) and Rrp2/RpoN/RpoS pathways. Beginning with acquisition, we re-evaluated the contribution of these pathways to spirochete survival and gene regulation throughout the enzootic cycle. Live imaging of Bb ``caught in the act'' of being acquired revealed that the absence of RpoS and consequent derepression of tick-phase genes imparts a ``Stay'' signal required for midgut colonization. In addition to the behavioral changes brought on by the RpoS-OFF state, acquisition requires activation of c-di-GMP synthesis by the Hk1/Rrp1 TCS; Bb lacking either component are destroyed during the blood meal. Prior studies attributed this dramatic phenotype to a metabolic lesion stemming from reduced glycerol uptake and utilization. In a head-to-head comparison, however, Δglp Bb had a markedly greater capacity to survive tick feeding than either Δhk1 or Δrrp1 Bb, establishing unequivocally that glycerol metabolism is only one component of the protection afforded by c-di-GMP. Data presented herein suggest that the protective response mediated by c-di-GMP is multifactorial, involving chemotactic responses, utilization of alternate substrates for energy generation and intermediary metabolism and remodeling of the cell envelope as a means of defending spirochetes against threats engendered during the blood meal. Expression profiling of c-di-GMP-regulated genes through the enzootic cycle supports our contention that the Hk1/Rrp1 TCS functions primarily, if not exclusively, in ticks. These data also raise the possibility that c-di-GMP enhances the expression of a subset of RpoS-dependent genes during nymphal transmission.},

	Abstract = {Borrelia burgdorferi encodes a novel DNA-binding protein in the Fur/PerR family of transcriptional regulators termed BosR (BB0647). This issue of Molecular Microbiology contains two molecular genetic studies that help to clarify the function of BB0647 and resolve longstanding controversies. Loss of BB0647 appears to have a pronounced effect on borrelial gene expression and, in one study, caused significant in vitro growth defects. BB0647 was also found to be essential for infection of the mammalian host but not the tick vector. Both Ouyang et al. and Hyde et al. also demonstrate, quite unexpectedly, that BB0647 is required for induction of RpoS, an alternative sigma factor that controls a cadre of B. burgdorferi genes, most notably ospC, which enable the spirochetes to establish mammalian infection following tick inoculation. There are still many unanswered questions regarding the precise physiological role of BB0647, the most important of which relate to its homologues Fur and PerR: to what extent does it regulate either the response to oxidative stress and/or transition metal uptake? The mechanism(s) whereby BB0647 interfaces with the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway also remains to be discerned. However, these two seminal papers establish BB0647 (BosR) as a central player in the molecular biology and physiology of B. burgdorferi as well as the pathogenesis of Lyme disease.},

	Abstract = {Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the Lyme disease spirochaete, encodes a potential ferric uptake regulator (Fur) homologue, BosR (BB0647). Thus far, a role for BosR in Bb metabolism, gene regulation or pathogenesis has not been determined, largely due to the heretofore inability to inactivate bosR in low-passage, infectious Bb isolates. Herein, we report the generation of the first bosR-deficient mutant in a virulent strain of Bb. Whereas the bosR mutant persisted normally in ticks, the mutant was unable to infect mice, indicating that BosR is essential for Bb infection of a mammalian host. Moreover, transcriptional profiling of the bosR mutant showed that a number of genes were either positively or negatively influenced by BosR deficiency, suggesting that BosR may function both as a global repressor and activator in Bb. Strikingly, our study showed that BosR controls the expression of two major virulence-associated Bb lipoproteins, OspC and DbpA, likely via an influence on the alternative sigma factor, RpoS. This study thus not only has elucidated another key virulence gene of Bb, but also provides new insights into a previously unknown layer of gene regulation governing RpoS in Bb.},

	Abstract = {Differential gene expression is a key strategy adopted by the Lyme disease spirochaete, Borrelia burgdorferi, for adaptation and survival in the mammalian host and the tick vector. Many B. burgdorferi surface lipoproteins fall into two distinct groups according to their expression patterns: one group primarily expressed in the tick and the other group primarily expressed in the mammal. Here, we show that the Fur homologue in this bacterium, also known as Borrelia oxidative stress regulator (BosR), is required for repression of outer surface protein A (OspA) and OspD in the mammal. Furthermore, BosR binds directly to sequences upstream of the ospAB operon and the ospD gene through recognition of palindromic motifs similar to those recognized by other Fur homologues but with a 1 bp variation in the spacer length. Putative BosR binding sites have been identified upstream of 156 B. burgdorferi genes. Some of these genes share the same expression pattern as ospA and ospD. Most notably, 12 (67\%) of the 18 genes previously identified in a genome-wide microarray study to be most significantly repressed in the mammal are among the putative BosR regulon. These data indicate that BosR may directly repress transcription of many genes that are downregulated in the mammal.},

In this study, we introduced an improved EMSA-based SELEX-Seq strategy with several advantages. The improvements of this strategy included: (1) using a FAM-labeled probe to track protein-DNA complex in polyacrylamide gel for rapidly recovering the protein-bound dsDNA without relying on traditional radioactive labeling or ethidium bromide staining; (2) monitoring the specificity of SELEX selection by detecting a positive and negative sequence doped into the input DNAs used in each round with PCR amplification; (3) using nested PCR to ensure the specificity of PCR amplification of the selected DNAs after each round; (4) using the nucleotides added at the 5' end of the nested PCR primers as the split barcode to code DNAs from various rounds for multiplexing sequencing samples. The split barcode minimized selection times and thus greatly simplified the current SELEX-Seq procedure. The reliability of the strategy was demonstrated by performing a successful SELEX-Seq of a well-known transcription factor, NF-κB. Therefore, this study provided a useful SELEX-Seq strategy for characterizing DNA-binding specificities of transcription factors.},

	Abstract = {Oligonucleotide aptamers are selected from libraries typically comprising up to 1015 different sequences by an iterative process of binding, separation, amplification and purification, called SELEX. During this process, the diversity of the oligonucleotide pool decreases until, presumably, only sequences with highest binding affinities towards chosen targets remain. This selection technique is time-consuming, labor-intensive and expensive. Though well posed in principles, the SELEX procedure is noise sensitive, due to amplification of unspecific-binding sequences, and it is not surprising that aptamer selection is often not successful in practice. In view of that, a follow-up of the progress of selection during its course with simple yet reliable methods is necessary. In this paper, we describe five independent assays to estimate the sequence complexity of SELEX pools including qualitative restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, melting curve analysis, quantitative fluorescence intensity measurements of bound ssDNA, real time PCR quantification and pool dissociation constant analysis during the progress of aptamer selection against streptavidin. Properties and features of each method are discussed and compared. Pool dissociation constant analysis and sequencing serve as reference methods.},

	Abstract = {Clinical diagnosis and research into transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are hampered by the lack of sufficiently sensitive and specific reagents able to adequately detect the normal cellular form of the prion protein, PrPC, and the pathological isoform, PrPSc. In order to provide such reagents, we applied Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) against a recombinant murine prion protein, to select single-stranded DNA ligands (aptamers) of high affinity. The SELEX protocol and subsequent aptamer characterisation employed protein immobilisation/partitioning using nickel-complexed magnetic particles and a novel SYBR Green-mediated quantitative real-time PCR technique. Following eight rounds of selection, the enriched aptamer pool was cloned and 24 clones sequenced. Seven of these were `orphan' clones and the remainder were grouped into three separate T-rich families. All but four of the aptamer clones exhibited specific binding to the murine prion protein and the majority also bound to human and ovine prion proteins. Dissociation constants (Kd) ranged from 18 to 79 nM. Flow cytometry with fluorescein-labelled aptamers confirmed that binding to cells was dependent on the expression of PrPC. Preliminary studies also indicate that a trivalent aptamer pool is capable of binding the pathological isoform PrPSc following guanidinium denaturation.},

@article{zhi_bba33_2015,
	Abstract = {Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, adapts to the mammalian hosts by differentially expressing several genes in the BosR and Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS dependent pathways, resulting in a distinct protein profile relative to that seen for survival in the Ixodes spp. tick. Previous studies indicate that a putative lipoprotein, BBA33, is produced in an RpoS-dependent manner under conditions that mimic the mammalian component of the borrelial lifecycle. However, the significance and function for BBA33 is not known. Given its linkage to the BosR/Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS regulatory cascade, we hypothesized that BBA33 facilitates B. burgdorferi infection in the mammalian host. The deletion of bba33 eliminated B. burgdorferi infectivity in C3H mice, which was rescued by genetic complementation with intact bba33. With regard to function, a combinatorial peptide approach, coupled with subsequent in vitro binding assays, indicated that BBA33 binds to collagen type VI and, to a lesser extent, collagen type IV. Whole cell binding assays demonstrated BBA33-dependent binding to human collagen type VI. Taken together, these results suggest that BBA33 interacts with collagenous structures and may function as an adhesin in a process that is required to prevent bacterial clearance.},

@article{riley_selex-seq_2014,
	Abstract = {The closely related members of the Hox family of homeodomain transcription factors have similar DNA-binding preferences as monomers, yet carry out distinct functions in vivo. Transcription factors often bind DNA as multiprotein complexes, raising the possibility that complex formation might modify their DNA binding specificities. To test this hypothesis we developed a new experimental and computational platform, termed SELEX-seq, to characterize DNA binding specificities of Hox-based multiprotein complexes. We found that complex formation with the same cofactor reveals latent specificities that are not observed for monomeric Hox factors. The findings from this in vitro platform are consistent with in vivo data, and the `latent specificity' concept serves as a precedent for how the specificities of similar transcription factors might be distinguished in vivo. Importantly, the SELEX-seq platform is flexible and can be used to determine the relative affinities to any DNA sequence for any transcription factor or multiprotein complex.},

	Abstract = {The Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, must abundantly produce outer surface lipoprotein A (OspA) in the tick vector but downregulate OspA in mammals in order to evade the immune system and maintain its natural enzootic cycle. Here, we show that BosR binds two regulatory elements of the ospAB operon and that increasing BosR expression leads to downregulation of OspA. Both regulatory sequences, cisI and cisII, showed strong BosR-binding and cisII bound much tighter than cisI. A promoterless bosR gene fused with an inducible promoter was introduced into an rpoS mutant and a wild-type strain to assess RpoS-independent and -dependent downregulation of OspA by BosR. With the induction of BosR expression, OspA expression was reduced more significantly in the RpoS-deficient than wild-type background, but not completely repressed. In the presence of constitutive expression of OspC, DbpA and DbpB, increasing BosR production resulted in complete repression of OspA in the RpoS mutant. Taken together, the study clearly demonstrated BosR serves as a repressor that binds both regulatory elements of the ospAB operon and shuts off expression.},

Transmission from the tick to the mammal, acquisition from the mammal back to the tick, and adaptation to the two disparate environments require sensing signals and responding by regulating programs of gene expression. The molecular mechanisms utilized to effect these lifestyle changes have begun to be elucidated and feature an alternative sigma factor cascade in which RpoN (σ(54)) and RpoS (σ(S)) globally control the genes required for the different phases of the enzootic cycle. The RpoN-RpoS pathway is surprisingly complex, entailing Rrp2, an unusual enhancer-binding protein and two-component regulatory system response regulator activated by acetyl phosphate; BosR, an unorthodox DNA-binding protein; DsrA(Bb), a small noncoding RNA; and Hfq and CsrA, two RNA-binding proteins. B. burgdorferi also has a c-di-GMP signaling system that regulates the tick side of the enzootic cycle and whose function is only beginning to be appreciated.},

Lyme disease, caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), remains the most common arthropod-borne illness in the United States. A critical strategy for Bb to maintain its presence in nature is adaptation to its diverse tick and mammalian (mouse) hosts. To accomplish this, Bb encodes a potential gene regulator, BB0647 (BosR). Herein, we confirmed that BosR is essential for Bb to establish mammalian infection. We then found that purified recombinant BosR bound to the promoter DNA (regulatory region) of rpoS, suggesting that BosR directly controls the expression of the rpoS gene. This study has revealed a new mechanism of bacterial gene control. The discovery that BosR governs Bb's virulence may lead to new strategies to interrupt the bacterium's complex life cycle.},

@article{seshu_conservative_2004,
	Abstract = {Borrelia burgdorferi, the aetiologic agent of Lyme disease, modulates gene expression in response to changes imposed by its arthropod vector and mammalian hosts. As reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to vary in these environments, we asked how B. burgdorferi responds to oxidative stress. The B. burgdorferi genome encodes a PerR homologue (recently designated BosR) that represses the oxidative stress response in other bacteria, suggesting a similar function in B. burgdorferi. When we tested the sensitivity of B. burgdorferi to ROS, one clonal non-infectious B. burgdorferi isolate exhibited hypersensitivity to t-butyl hydroperoxide when compared with infectious B. burgdorferi and other non-infectious isolates. Sequence analysis indicated that the hypersensitive non-infectious isolates bosR allele contained a single nucleotide substitution, converting an arginine to a lysine (bosRR39K). Mutants in bosRR39K exhibited an increase in resistance to oxidative stressors when compared with the parental non-infectious strain, suggesting that BosRR39K functioned as a repressor. Complementation with bosRR39K and bosR resulted in differential sensitivity to t-butyl hydroperoxide, indicating that these alleles are functionally distinct. In contrast to BosR, BosRR39K did not activate transcription of a napA promoter--lacZ reporter in Escherichia coli nor bind the napA promoter/operator domain. However, we found that both BosR and BosRR39K bound to the putative promoter/operator region of superoxide dismutase (sodA). In addition, we determined that cells lacking BosRR39K  synthesized  fourfold  greater  levels  of the decorin binding adhesin DbpA suggesting that BosRR39K regulates genes unrelated to oxidative stress. Based on these data, we propose that the single amino acid substitution, R39K, dramatically alters the activity of BosR by altering its ability to bind DNA at target regulatory sequences.},
